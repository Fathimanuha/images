This repository contains the Power BI file for a professional Sales Performance Dashboard designed for executive-level oversight and in-depth product analysis. The dashboard utilizes a sleek, dark-themed UI to minimize distraction and enhance data visibility, emphasizing key metrics such as Total Sales ($\$83K$) and Year-over-Year (YoY) performance. Key features include a detailed Profit Breakdown by Product (e.g., Paseo, VTT, Amarilla), a geographical analysis of Sales by Country (with focus on major markets like United States and Canada), and a powerful Date Slicer for interactive time filtering. The design effectively uses a combination of bar charts, donut charts, and trend lines—including a clear Sum of Profit by Year line chart—to provide a comprehensive and attractive overview of sales health and product contribution, showcasing proficiency in advanced Power BI visualization and data storytelling.
